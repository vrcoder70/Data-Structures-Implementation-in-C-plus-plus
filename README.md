- **Circular Link List**
- **Double Circular Link List**

## 2. Queue
- **Queue**
- **Priority Queue**
- **Circular Queue**
- **Circular Double Queue**

## 3. Stack 
- **Stack**
- **Infix to Prefix Expression Conversion using Stack**
- **Infix to Postfix Expression Conversion using Stack**

## 4. Sorting Algorithms

### a) Bubble Sort
- *Time Complexity*: O(n^2) - Quadratic time
- *Space Complexity*: O(1) - Constant space
- *Description*: Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements to sort the list.

### b) Counting Sort
- *Time Complexity*: O(n + k) - Linear time
- *Space Complexity*: O(n + k) - Linear space
- *Description*: Suitable for sorting integers within a small, non-negative range using a counting method.

### c) Insertion Sort
- *Time Complexity*: O(n^2) - Quadratic time
- *Space Complexity*: O(1) - Constant space
- *Description*: Builds a sorted list by repeatedly moving elements to their correct position.

### d) Quick Sort
- *Time Complexity*: O(n^2) worst-case, O(n log n) average-case
- *Space Complexity*: O(log n) - Logarithmic space
- *Description*: Divides the input into smaller parts, sorts them, and is known for its efficiency.

### e) Selection Sort
- *Time Complexity*: O(n^2) - Quadratic time
- *Space Complexity*: O(1) - Constant space
- *Description*: Finds the minimum element and places it in the right position in each pass.

## 5. Phone Library
- A phone library implemented in C++ that supports basic operations like insert, update, delete, and search on phone records.

## 6. Sparse Matrix
- Sparse matrix creation from a normal matrix, and addition and subtraction of matrices.
